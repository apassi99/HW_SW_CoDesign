# Nios II Custom Instruction Example

The Custom Instruction example provides a small explanation to transforming a simple software program into a combination or cyclic based hardware description. For more information read https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/ug/ug_nios2_custom_instruction.pdf. The example provided is a combinational custom instruction (XOR operation) which is logic block that completes its logic function in a single clock cycle.
